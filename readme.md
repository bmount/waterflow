Ongoing experiment, some of the idea and motivation is discussed
[here](http://partialmap.tumblr.com/post/42826697787/slow-weather-records).

You can use a related project at `../hgt2png` to generate the data source image,
for example the larger Bay Area file is created like this:

`hgt2png --bbox -122.560730 37.680560 -122.242126 37.868349`
